Cassette exon is the largest category (over 60%) of alternative exon which includes many other forms, like alternative 5' splicing, alternative 3' splicing, mutually exlusive exon, etc. **[1,2]** Cassette exon is related to disease, like SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy), a neorodegenerative disorder, which is direclty caused by SMN1 defiency. The inclusion of exon-7 among SMN gene leads to SMN1 transcripts in normal people, while the unexpected exlusion (or skipping) leads to SMN2 which finally results in infantile death. **[3,4]** This example indicates RNA splicing is worthwhile to be studied and also that is why SMN1/SMN2 becomes the model isoform in RNA splicing research field. \r\n\r\n# Work Flow\r\n\r\nThis package aims to find all the cassette exon based on well-documented annotation. Indeed, this is simplly texts filering work. \r\n\r\n![Working Flow](https://raw.github.com/Puriney/Textbook-Alternative-Exon/master/figures/cassette_exon_finder%E6%B5%81%E7%A8%8B%E5%9B%BE.png)\r\n\r\nThe key is to find all the exons absent in one isoform are precisely present in the corresponding intron of anther differnt isoform among the same gene. \r\n\r\n![cassette exon](https://raw.github.com/Puriney/Textbook-Alternative-Exon/master/figures/cassette_exon_inclustion_ratio%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F.png)\r\n\r\n# Perl Scripts\r\n\r\n1. `uniq_intron_producer.pl`\r\n2. `exon_with_flanking_corrd_producer.pl`\r\n3. `strict_cassette_exon_producer.pl`\r\n4. `cassette_exon_simplifier.pl` (which is optional)\r\n\r\n# Others\r\n\r\nAs Perl is used as a scaffold, BEDTools toolbox must be employed here for convinience. \r\n\r\n# Refs\r\n\r\n1.
